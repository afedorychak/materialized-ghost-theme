Materialzed - A theme for Ghost that implements MaterializeCSS
===================================

This project serves as a learning tool for basic Vala development and game logic. It is not (and will probably never be) considered a finished product and is nowhere near ready for popular consumption.

In other words, use at your own risk and don't look at this project as a model Vala project.

Install
=======

If you are looking to hack on the theme, download the source and extract it (keeping the folder structure) into your ../ghost/content/theme directory.

If you simply want to install and deploy this to your existing Ghost site, download the zip file and upload it to your Ghost site as the active theme.
