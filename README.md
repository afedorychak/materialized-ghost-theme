# materialized-ghost-theme
An implementation of the Materialize framework for Ghost

Just download as a zip and either upload it to your hosted Ghost instance or add it to your themes folder.

You can see a real-world implementation of it at my website here - http://egee.io/ . I've made minor changes to fit my own needs, and of course the source code is available under the GPLv2.
